Given the potentially vast number of biology preprints — several hundred thousand papers each year — it was clear that bioRxiv would require an industrial scale architecture that could process and display a high volume of submissions and stably accommodate millions of online readers with minimal downtimes. bioRxiv’s hosting and manuscript management sites would have to include state-of-the-art features biologists had come to expect of online journals and be able to accommodate both existing and future integrations with other participants in the scholarly communication ecosystem (e.g. search engines, indexing services, journals, and manuscript submission systems). After defining the specifications required, we partnered with HighWire Press, a company developed within and part-owned by Stanford University that had a proven record of more than 20 years in online manuscript hosting and technology development for clients including the American Academy for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and The National Academy of Sciences (NAS).
